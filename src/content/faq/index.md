faqs:
  - title: Is there a web app?
    answer: Not yet! That is definitely in the works for the future, but for the moment (immediately post-launch), the focus will be on the iOS and Android apps.

  - title: Do I have to pay to use Statehouse App?
    answer: No! Statehouse App is free to use for up to three projects, each with up to three bills to track. If you'd like more than that, or to have multiple users collaborating on a project, you'll need to update to the Premium plan ($99.99/yr or $9.99/mo).

    answer: Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, so you can cancel at anytime through your account there.

    answer: Legislative data is updated nightly.

  - title: Do you harvest/sell data?
    answer: We will never, under any circumstances, sell any kind of user or usage data.
